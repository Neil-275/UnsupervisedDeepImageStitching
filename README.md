# Unsupervised Deep Image Stitching: Reconstructing Stitched Images from Feature to Pixel (paper)

Traditional feature-based image stitching technologies rely heavily on the quality of feature detection, often failing to stitch images with few features or at low resolution. The recent learning-based methods can only be supervisedly trained in a synthetic dataset instead of the real dataset, for the stitched labels under large parallax are difficult to obtain.
